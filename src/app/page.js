          My name is Adam Purcell (located in the Chicagoland area), and
          I&apos;ve been on my own fitness journey for the past 5 years. Along
          the way, I discovered a deep passion for bodybuilding and overall
          wellness. What started as a personal goal turned into a lifestyle, and
          now I&apos;m driven to help others experience the same transformation.
          Whether it&apos;s building strength, gaining confidence, or just
          feeling better day to day, I love guiding people toward their fitness
          goals. I believe with the right support and plan, anyone can unlock
          their potentialâ€”and I&apos;m here to help make that happen.
