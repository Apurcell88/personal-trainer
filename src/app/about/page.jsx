          Hi, I'm Adam Purcell. My journey into fitness started over 5 years ago
          as a personal mission to become stronger, healthier, and more
          confident. Over time, that mission evolved into a deep passion for
          helping others do the same. While my early experience has been focused
          on training family and friends, it's given me the chance to develop a
          hands-on, personalized approach thatâ€™s rooted in real-world results.
          I'm a certified personal trainer through the American Council on
          Exercise (ACE), and I bring both professional knowledge and personal
          commitment to every session. Whether you're just starting out or
          looking to level up your training, I'm here to guide you with a plan
          that fits your lifestyle, goals, and potential.{" "}
